1-9. [3] Prove the correctness of the following algorithm for evaluating a polynomial a_n*x^n + a_n−1*x^n−1 + ··· + a_1*x + a_0.

Horner(a, x) 
    p = a_n
    for i from n − 1 to 0 
        p = p · x + a_i
    return p


Proof:
Induction on n didn't get me anywhere. So I opt for a direct proof.

We start with the partial sum a_n and perform n iterations, each which 1) multiplies the partial sum by x and 2) adds the next lower a term a_i.

n iterations follow a_n, so the a_n term is a_n*x^n.
for any a_i, [i-1, 0] iterations follow it, for a total of i. So the a_i term is a_i*x^i.
