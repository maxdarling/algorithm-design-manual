1-29. [4] A sorting algorithm takes 1 second to sort 1,000 items on your machine. How long will it take to sort 10,000 items. . .
(a) if you believe that the algorithm takes time proportional to n^2, and
(b) if you believe that the algorithm takes time proportional to nlogn 


Ans: 
- a) Assume 1000ms = 1/1000 * 1000^2 so, 1/1000 * 10000^2 = *100s*
- b) Assume 1000ms = 1/10 * 1000log(1000), so 1/10 * 10000log(10000) = ~*33s*


Very rough! Didn't bother to use any other terms or constants...so it's a super basic solution.
