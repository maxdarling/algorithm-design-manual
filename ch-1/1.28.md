1-28. [3] Is disk drive access time normally measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second) or microseconds (millionths of a second)? Does your RAM memory access a word in more or less than a microsecond? How many instructions can your CPU execute in one year if the machine is left running all the time?


Ans: 
- Disk drive: wtf is access time? Time to read? Time to seek? I'll say microseconds, fuck it.  
- RAM: I'll say more than a microsecond.
- CPU: 3700k clockspeed = 3.7m instructions per second? So 3.7m * 3600 * 24 * 365 = 1.166832e14 or 116 trillion
