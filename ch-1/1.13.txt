1-13. [3] Prove that sum_{i=1, n}(i^2) = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 for n â‰¥ 0, by induction.


Base case: n = 0
sum_{i=1, 0}(i^2) = 0 = 0(0+1)(2*0 +1)/6.

Inductive case: assume true for k >= 0; we'll prove for k+1

sum_{i=1, k+1}(i^2) = (k+1)^2 + sum_{i=1, k}(i^2) = (k+1)^2 + k(k+1)(2k+1)/6 = (k+1)(6(k+1) + k(2k+1))/6 = 
(k+1)(2k^2 + 7k + 6)/6 = (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)/6. QED.
