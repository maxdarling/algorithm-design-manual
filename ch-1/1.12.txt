1-12. [3] Prove that sum_{i=1, n}(i) = n(n + 1)/2 for n â‰¥ 0, by induction.


Proof: 
Base case: when n = 0, sum_{i=1, 0}(i) = 0 = 0(0 + 1)/2. 

Inductive case: assume true for some k >= 0. We'll show true for k + 1. 
sum_{i=1, k+1}(i) = k+1 + sum_{i=1, k}(i) = k+1 + k(k+1)/2 = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2 = (k+1)(k+2)/2.
