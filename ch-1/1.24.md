1-24. [3] Estimate how many cities and towns there are in the United States.

Ans: 
- Q: do these depend on population, or land mass? Both loosely? This is hard, each state probably draws the line at town/city differently.

- Here's a cheeky approach? US population is 350 million. Cities have an average of 50,000 people, and towns have an average of 5,000. And each person belongs to one city and one town. So it follows that there's 7,000 cities andand 70,000 towns. Both of those figures seem small to me...
