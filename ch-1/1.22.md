1-22. [3] How many words are there in this textbook?



Ans: 
- 800 pages
- this page has 31 lines, and seems about average. Many pages are denser, but some are far less dense with graphics.
- Counting a # of words per line on several lines, it seems ~13 is a good guess.
- Total: 800 * 31 * 13 = 322k


Sanity check: iirc from hs/college essay word counts, a single spaced page has 500 words. 800 * 500 = 400k, not bad.
