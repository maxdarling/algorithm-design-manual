1-5. [4] Knapsack problem counterexamples


(a) Put the elements of S in the knapsack in left to right order if they fit, i.e. the first-fit algorithm.

S = {1,2}, T = 2

(b) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from smallest to largest, i.e. the best-fit algorithm.

S = {1,2}, T = 2

(c) Put the elements of S in the knapsack from largest to smallest.

S = {2, 3, 4}, T = 5
