1-21. [3] Do all the books you own total at least one million pages? How many total pages are stored in your school library?


Ans: 
- I own less than 100 books, and they're no more than 1000 pages on average as a very conservative estimate, which is 100k. So no. 

- Library:
    - Pages/book: 
    Assume average paperback is 350 pages, average textbook is 1000 pages,and 2:1 distribution of paperbacks to textbooks. Thus 1700 / 3 = 566 pages/book.
