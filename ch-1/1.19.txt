1-19. [3] Prove by induction that a tree with n vertices has exactly n âˆ’ 1 edges.

n=1
A tree with 1 node has no edges. 

Inductive step: assume true for n=k, we'll prove for k+1

Take any leaf node and delete it, along with its single edge. Now we have a tree with k vertices. By the inductive hypothesis, it must have k-1 edges. Add back the deleted vertex and edge, now we have k+1 vertices and k edges. QED.
